# ABPEPserver

Cancer cells experience tryptophan shortage as a consequence of interferon-gamma (IFN) signaling pathway. It has been recently demonstrated that such tryptophan shortage leads to tryptophan to phenylalanine codon reassignment (W>F) resulting into aberrant peptide product. 
ABPEPserver offers the visualization of a large-scale proteomics analysis of multiple human cancer types in which aberrant peptides are detected. In this analysis, tryptophan to phenylalanine (W>F) codon reassignment were found to be a vastly abundant phenomenon in multiple cancer types. Furthermore, these W>F mis-incorporations, called W>F substitutants, were found to be enriched in tumors as compared with adjacent normal tissues, and often their appearance was associated with T-cell and oncogenic signaling activities.
Proteomic cancer data from multiple cancer types, hosted by PDC commons database, have been used in this analysis. An in depth description of how the analysis was conducted is shown in the 'Methods' tab. The 'Cancer types' tab shows cancer types analyzed and includes information about each proteomic dataset.
This server will enable ease and fast access to aberrant peptides, which are potent immunotherapeutic targets and hence of high value.
Results are available in:

Barplots depicting cumulative number of W-substitutants detected in tumour and adjacent normal tissue samples.
Violin plots depicting the number of substitutions detected in low (intensity < 0) and high (intensity >0) tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples.
Scatter contour plots depicting for every gene the number of W>F substitutions when the gene is higher expressed (intensity > 0) on X-axis (High Class) and when the gene is lower expressed (intensity < 0) on Y-axis (Low Class).
Excel file outputs with the list of aberrant peptides.
